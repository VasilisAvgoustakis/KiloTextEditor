An easy way to make tcgetattr() fail is to give your program a text file or a pipe as the standard input instead of your terminal. 
To give it a file as standard input, run ./kilo <kilo.c. To give it a pipe, run echo test | ./kilo. 
Both should result in the same error from tcgetattr(), something like Inappropriate ioctl for device.
